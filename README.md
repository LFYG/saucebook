# Saucebook
Saucebook is a simple front end for a fictitious social cookbook website that was used to demonstrate UEStudio's new Git integration. We're leaving it on our GitHub page for anyone who'd like to clone and fork as desired. Who knows? Maybe one day we can wire this up with [Meteor.js](http://meteor.com) or something and build a working community pet project.

Got a creative tweak to add? Pull requests welcome!

## Requirements

If you want to edit our Sass (.scss) files, you'll need to have the following items installed.

  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer provided on the NodeJS website.
  * [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): Run `[sudo] npm install -g grunt-cli`
  * [Bower](http://bower.io): Run `[sudo] npm install -g bower`

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone git@github.com:zurb/foundation-libsass-template.git
npm install && bower install
```

While you're working on the project, run:

`grunt`

...and your system will monitor Sass files for changes.

## Directory Structure

  * `scss/app.scss`: Application styles go here
